In this lab, you will practice coding different Monte Carlo simulations. We use the example of [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) here, but you do not need to know any specifics about the game - just that the [Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox) and [Astros](https://www.mlb.com/astros) are two US baseball teams. 

Assume the baseball playoffs are about to start. During the first round of the playoffs, teams play a best of five series. After the first round, they play seven game series.

### Question 1

The Red Sox and Astros are playing a five-game series. Assume they are equally good. This means each game is like a coin toss. Build a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability that the Red Sox win the series. 
**Solution:**
```{r}
series_outcome <- function(n) {
    x <- sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE)
    sum(x) >= (n + 1) / 2
}
```

We can now perform a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of winning the series. We play the series 10,000 times.

```{r}
results <- replicate(10000, series_outcome(n = 5))
mean(results)
```

### Question 2

The answer to Question 1 is not surprising. What if one of the teams is better? Compute the probability that the Red Sox win the series if the Astros are better and have a 60% chance of winning each game.

**Solution:**
We first modify the `series_outcome` function to also take `p` (the probability of the Red Sox winning each game) as a parameter.

```{r}
series_outcome <- function(n, p) {
    x <- sample(c(0,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1 - p, p))
    sum(x) >= (n + 1) / 2
}
```

We again replicate the series 10,000 times using a Monte Carlo simulation.

```{r}
results <- replicate(10000, series_outcome(n = 5, p = 0.4))
mean(results)
```

Here, since `n` is small, it is also possible to use `pbinom` to calculate the exact binomial probability. If the Astros are better and have a 60% chance of winning each game, the probability of the Red Sox winning the series decreases.

### Question 3

How does this probability change if instead of five games, they play seven? How about three? What law did you learn that explains this?

**Solution:**
```{r}
results <- replicate(10000, series_outcome(n = 7, p = 0.4))
mean(results)

results <- replicate(10000, series_outcome(n = 3, p = 0.4))
mean(results)
```

Again, since `n` is small, it is also possible to use `pbinom` to calculate the exact binomial probabilities. If they play seven games instead of five, the probability of the Red Sox winning the series is smaller. If they play three games, the probability is greater. This can be explained by the law of large numbers, and more directly, by the fact that the standard error of the average (here, the proportion of games won by the Red Sox) decreases with increasing $n$. 

### Question 4

Now, assume again that the two teams are equally good. What is the probability that the Red Sox still win the series if they lose the first game? Do this for a five game and seven game series.

**Solution:**
```{r}
after_one_loss <- function(n) {
    x <- sample(c(0, 1), n - 1, replace = TRUE)
    sum(x) >= (n + 1) / 2
}
results <- replicate(10000, after_one_loss(n = 5))
mean(results)

results <- replicate(10000, after_one_loss(n = 7))
mean(results)
```
